## Test



[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) - A [free and editable map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap) of the whole world is celebrating its [12th year](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Birthday) with 2.94 million enthusiastic community mappers around the world. The map has been constructed with around [3.48 billion nodes, 363 million ways and 4.4 million relations](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats) and these number counts are rising day by day with an enormous inclusion of data every instance. The OpenStreetMap community has a [growth of 10% every month](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Press_Kit) which unleashes various possibilities with more data and larger community.  

Mapbox is constantly contributing high quality data to OpenStreetMap through their mapping projects and we are currently working closely with community on [navigational mapping projects](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping). Along with improving data on OSM, we also [validate data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-RYUIULN6U&index=23&list=PLqjPa29lMiE3eR-gK80irr3xdUiRbIMeg) on OSM regularly to check for invalid edits and to keep OSM free from vandalism.


Also, the highly responsive charitable community The [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://hotosm.org/) which coordinates crisis mapping responses of the OpenStreetMap community to natural and humanitarian disasters across the world relies completely on OSM and has supported in [44 crisis situations](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team) till date. At Mapbox we routinely participate in these responses following HOT's official activations. 
 

OpenStreetMap is the only place to find and map the [missing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Missing_Maps_Project)/unmapped regions of the world.

The huge open geospatial data being updated everyday, is accessible by everyone and being used for various studies, analysis and research.
